	                <p> Hello Dear Reader,</p>
	                   <p></p>
	                   <p style=" text-indent: 15px">Welcome to Coventry University Navigations the first dedicated mapping service for
	                   Coventry University. We have been designed by students, built by students and will
	                   be developed by students.</p>
	                   <p></p>
	                   <p style=" text-indent: 15px">So now we have the corporate line out the way letâ€™s talk about what we can do for you. 
	                   Imagine you just arrived at the university (we all have been through this) and you have no idea
	                   where anything is, where do you go to find this information out. Simple come to us.</p>
	                   <p></p>
	                   <p style=" text-indent: 15px">What we offer is a campus mapping service that will let you find a building in the campus and 
	                   plan a route to it. I hear you saying "Google already does this" well what Google doesn't offer
	                   is a dedicated list of every building in the university with their abbreviations so you can easily find
	                   where you want to go.</p>
	                   <p></p>
	                   <p style=" text-indent: 15px">In addition to this we offer a dedicated set of floor plans for each building so you can find your way around 
	                   every building on campus. To complement this we offer a snapshot of information for each building so you can find
	                   out what that building does, the address of that building and it's opening times. With a link to the University's webpage
	                   on the building so you don't have to look for it.</p>
	                   <p></p>
	                   <p style=" text-indent: 15px">Now in the opening paragraph I said that students will develop this site, we meant it. That is why we are asking you
	                   for feedback on the site and giving you the opportunity to tell us what you want on the site. We are serious when we say
	                   the site is for students and as such we want it to be what they want. So please get in touch using the contact 
	                   information opposite.</p> 
	                   <p></p>
	               <p>Regards,</p>
	                        <p style=" text-indent: 30px"><i>The Coventry University Navigation Team</i></p>
